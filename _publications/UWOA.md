In this research, we propose a technique for categorizing breast cancer from breast ultrasound images utilizing deep learning and feature-selection algorithms based on meta-heuristic methods. We first extract features from ultrasound breast images using a standard deep learning model and following which we choose an optimal set of features from this deep feature set using an unsupervised version of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (U-WOA). We select the leader agent in U-WOA using a pseudo-fitness value which is calculated using three rank-based feature filter methods. The overall framework aims to reduce the presence of redundant and non-informative features extracted from the deep learner to build a more robust framework. The proposed approach yields state-of-the-art classification performances on a standard benchmark breast cancer ultrasound dataset namely BUSI.
